#### Motivation
  Being a big binge-watcher since long time, i have always been looking for good movies/shows to watch online.but to my disappointment there are'nt
  many online community build around binge-watchers. talking about things you watch has to be one of the best way to bond with people. so there had to 
  be a place where you could share your opinions,things you like, your favourite movie,tv shows,dialogues,actor,director.. with your friends and know their opinions and prefrences too.
  
  **A good movie can change your life**

#### Project Description

the main goal of this project is to build a community around binge watchers where their opinions matters and they can connect better with their friends. As of now there are'nt many such websites, hopefully this will be a viable solution to that and end the waiting. overall objective of this
project is to cater to bingewatching community and to build something which i wanted to be built for myself. i'd be deeply honoured if this ends up inspiring people to develop what they always wanted and cater to needs of our community however small or insignificant that may be. 

#### Code Style
[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) – Style Guide for Python Code

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Spaces are the preferred indentation method.
- Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.
- Python disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.
- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
- For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters.
- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
- Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.

```python
	# Correct:

# Aligned with opening delimiter.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                         var_three, var_four)

# Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest.
def long_function_name(
        var_one, var_two, var_three,
        var_four):
    print(var_one)

# Hanging indents should add a level.
foo = long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)
#

```
```python
# No extra indentation.
if (this_is_one_thing and
    that_is_another_thing):
    do_something()

# Add a comment, which will provide some distinction in editors
# supporting syntax highlighting.
if (this_is_one_thing and
    that_is_another_thing):
    # Since both conditions are true, we can frobnicate.
    do_something()

# Add some extra indentation on the conditional continuation line.
if (this_is_one_thing
        and that_is_another_thing):
    do_something()
```
