#### Motivation
  Being a big binge-watcher since long time, i have always been looking for good movies/shows to watch online.but to my disappointment there are'nt
  many online community build around binge-watchers. talking about things you watch has to be one of the best way to bond with people. so there had to 
  be a place where you could share your opinions,things you like, your favourite movie,tv shows,dialogues,actor,director.. with your friends and know their opinions and prefrences too.


#### Project Description

the main goal of this project is to build a community around binge watchers where their opinions matters and they can connect better with their friends. As of now there are'nt many such websites, hopefully this will be a viable solution to that and end the waiting. overall objective of this
project is to cater to bingewatching community and to build something which i wanted to be built for myself. i'd be deeply honoured if this ends up inspiring people to develop what they always wanted and cater to needs of our community however small or insignificant that may be.
